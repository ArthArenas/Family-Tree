# Family-Tree
Windows Forms Application made in Visual Studio 2015 that explores a personalized family tree.

Formerly coded in Visual Basic, it's been now fully replaced by C#. The program will be largely improved to customize each user's view of the information displayed, feature encryption, use a DBMS (Database Management System). This was meant to be a personal project that I would not publish since it wasn't going to be generic for another user. The current published version is the one I made for myself and my family without including the file-based database (several text files) for obvious privacy reasons. The original motivation was, that one of my uncles wanted to have his family tree and paint it on a wall of his house, however, it is hard to have such a huge tree with 80+ people with pictures and a lot of information for each member! I've always been interested in having the full structure of my family including ancestors as well. So after a free-trial in ancestry.com and learning Visual Basic in the summer of 2017, I made a program to explore my family tree structure that has 150+ people, later, during the winter of 2017 I learned C# and started re-coding the whole project and added a lot of more features such as navigation through pictures, a deeper view of ancestors and personal profiles for each member which include education and work credentials, DOB, and more!. I will include over the next few months a sample structure with random generated names just to let you (interested people) see the workings of the application.

About documentation: The current C# version doesn't include documentation on pretty much anything, so I will be including it in the upcoming maintenance of the project as well.
