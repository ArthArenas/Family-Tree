# Family-Tree
Windows Forms Application made in Visual Studio 2015 that explores a personalized family tree.

The program will be largely improved to make it customized for the user, feature encryption, use a Microsoft Access database, allow to explore only the part of it that the user is concerned (to avoid the full exploration of personal information that should not be seen by non-relatives) and display more personal information such as birthdate, higher education, and more! This was meant to be a personal project that I would not publish since it wasn't going to be generic for another user. The current published version is the one I made for myself and my family without including the database (several text files) for obvious privacy reasons. The original motivation was, that one of my older uncles (brother of my grandma's) wanted to have his family tree and paint it in a wall, however, it is hard to have such a huge tree with 80+ people with pictures! I've always been interested in having the full structure of my family including ancestors as well. So after a free-trial in ancestry.com and learning Visual Basic in the summer of 2017, I made a program to explore my family tree structure that has 150+ people. I will soon include a sample structure with random generated names just to let you (interested people) see the workings of the application.
